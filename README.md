# HackerHank-30DaysChallenge
Some Hacker Hank problems solving


**Day 0: Hello, World** - To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.


**Day 1: Data Types** - Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
Read lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your variables.
Use the operator to perform the following operations:

Print the sum of plus your int variable on a new line.
Print the sum of plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
Concatenate with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line. 

**Day 2: Operators** - Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.  
Example    

mealCost = 100  
tipPercent = 15  
taxPercent = 8  
A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value and return from the function.

**Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements** - Given an integer, perform the following conditional actions:

if n is odd, print Weird 
if n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird  
if n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird  
if n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird


Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not
is weird.
